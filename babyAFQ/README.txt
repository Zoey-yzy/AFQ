Baby Automated Fiber Quantification
==============================

babyAFQ was designed to generate Tract Profiles of tissue properties for major fiber tracts in healthy and diseased infant brains. 

babyAFQ has been tested for MATLAB r2015a. It requires functions from the main AFQ distribution, MATLAB stats toolbox, vistasoft and SPM.
