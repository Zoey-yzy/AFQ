In babyAFQ tracts are genrally defined as in 
Wakana S, Caprihan A, Panzenboeck MM, et al. Reproducibility of quantitative tractography methods applied to cerebral white matter. Neuroimage. 2007;36(3):630‚Äê644. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.02.049


A few changes had to be made to account for the smaller size of baby brains:
- A third ROI has been introduced for curvey tracts: ATR, IFO, AF and UCI
- ILF posterior ROI has been split into two to separate ILF and mdLF
- pAF and VOF ROIs are included here
- SLF ROIs are restricted to parietal cortex
